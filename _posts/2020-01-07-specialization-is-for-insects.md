Just finished reading [this article about how being a multi-hyphen person is a great approach to life](https://humanparts.medium.com/the-case-for-being-a-multi-hyphenate-216e2e19a30d).

It is a nicely written (and very well argued) defense of the “specialization is for insects” idea, and it made me realize I have a long way to go with my own writing. English is not my first language, and it will take me a while to reach the expressiveness and depth of a native English writer.

_Accountability_ may be one of the reasons why I publish this blog. Do something wrong in public for long enough, and you’ll probably end up becoming semi decent at it. Private practice lacks the embarrassment factor, and I think that plays an important role in our drive to become better.

After all, _shame_ is the greatest regulator of social behavior. Its function is to allow us to see ourselves through the eyes of others, and thus evaluate how we’re doing in our relationships with them.
