description: A reflection on short term failure & long time success
---

When I set this blog up, one of the things I had in mind was *writing everyday*. It sounded like an achievable challenge, and I even made a nod to that idea in the URL for it: `ale.today` is the perfect address for a daily log.

I managed to do it for 7 days, but yesterday I broke my streak because I simply *forgot I had a blog* (weekends sometimes do that to people, don't they?.)

I could've said "well, I'll only write on work days, then". But that's just a recipe for disaster, because next time I'll forget to write on a Tuesday, and then I'd break my own rules for the second time.

I could be doing those things, and sabotaging my own happiness, but the truth of the thing is I couldn't care less about that.

You see, *I never promised myself (or anyone) I'd write every day*. The only promise I made myself was that I would write *more*, and the real reason I'm doing this is because I want to improve my writing.

My **long term goal** is to become a better writer. In the great scheme of things, failing to take 1 or 2 of the hundreds of steps I need to take to get where I want is *not a big deal*.

> Two steps forward, one step back

Progression is never linear when trying to achieve a (worthy) goal. There will *always* be an obstacle in the way, but you need to keep an eye on the trends and the net results. For me that means I'm writing (almost) every day, and I have a small collection of posts that I did not have before starting this adventure. I know I'll eventually get there, because *I'm in love with the long term goal*, writing streaks be damned.

I know this is going to sound like a self-help book, but the only truth about most things worth pursuing is this:

> You haven't failed until you give up.

P.S: I plan on writing about progress and determination a bit more in the future. As someone who has quit smoking, lost 20 Kg, and gone from being a couch potato to running a half marathon, I know a trick or two about that.
