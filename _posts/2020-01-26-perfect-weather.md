A zen master and his pupil walk through the woods at night. It is pitch black, and the weather is _terrible_: it is cold, windy, rain is pouring…

> Are you out of your fucking mind? How can you possibly think this weather is nice?

To which the zen master, still smiling, answers:

> This weather is _perfect_, because it's the only one we have.
