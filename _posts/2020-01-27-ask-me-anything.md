I recently came across the [awesome-ama](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas) list, and I have to admit that hosting your _Ask Me Anything_ system on GitHub is a brilliant idea.

So of course I've copied it, and now have my own AMA on GitHub: <https://github.com/bomberstudios/ama>. Not much action there yet, so feel free to visit and maybe ask a question or two.

Thanks in advance!
