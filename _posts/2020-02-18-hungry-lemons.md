Maya (2yo) just told me the best story ever.

According to her, the reason she wakes up every night is that a bunch of hungry lemons come knocking on her door. _Obviously_, she has to wake up and cook dinner for them (they like _salmon_, apparently).

When theyâ€™re done eating, a banana turns up and takes the lemons back home.

As a sign of gratitude, the lemons leave her a gift (usually a toy) the morning after.
