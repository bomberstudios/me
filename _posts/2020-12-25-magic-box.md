One of my new year’s resolutions for 2020 was [spending more time building happiness, and less time trying to buy it readymade](https://ale.today/lego-heart/).

In that spirit, this is the year I finally learnt to solder (thank you, mechanical keyboards obsession), and started dabbling with DIY electronics.

As an end of year project, I decided to build a Christmas gift for my wife (well, I actually planned on building it earlier in the year, but the parts took _forever_ to arrive). It is a box that thinks it’s a keyboard. You plug it to a computer, and it types pseudo-random love sentences when you press the green button (they’re not really random, I just wrote a very large list of them and the box picks a different one every time).

Getting it into a state where I would not be ashamed of gifting it was a small odyssey, but totally worth the trouble just for the look on my wife’s face when she started using it on Christmas day’s morning.

Here’s hope 2021 will bring more opportunities for this sort of “non-productive” hacking.

Have a Merry Xmas y’all!

P.S: I may update this post with technical details if I find some spare time during the holidays. No promises, though.
