[This MacUser article](https://archive.org/details/MacUser8712December1987/page/n164/mode/1up?view=theater) written in 1987 by none other than Douglas Adams, is both a fun review of HyperCard and a love letter to the personal computer.

I spend a lot of time using electronic tools for thought, but have never felt anything remotely close to what Adams describes.

Maybe it's time to start looking for better tools.
