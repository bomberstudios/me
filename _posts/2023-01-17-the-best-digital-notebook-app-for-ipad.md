At some point I may post a longer version of this insight, but here’s the 5-second summary: if you’re looking for an iPad app to replace your paper notebook, [Notability](https://notability.com) is hands-down the best option out there.

I went over all the other options over the Christmas break in case there was something better out there, but (at least for me) nothing beats Notability in terms of usability, features, and pricing.
