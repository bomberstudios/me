Since I moved away from Madrid City, one of the things I miss most is having a nice coffee place around the corner where I can have a decent [flat white](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_white). There are literally *zero* places nearby that serve good coffee.

While this recipe is no substitute for a great flat white, it’s definitely better than no flat white. You will need an AeroPress, a way to boil water, and a way to froth your milk. I used a small protein shaker and 30 seconds of vigorous arm movement, but you can [Google for better options](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+froth+your+milk).

## Recipe

- On your AeroPress, add 14 grams of coffee, ground for espresso or slightly coarser. I used 10 clicks on my Comandante and the results were reasonable. But coffee is all about personal preference, so use whatever works for you.
- Pour 94 grams of boiling water.
- Stir the coffee grounds for 20 seconds.
- Close the AeroPress and push. You should end up with 50-ish grams of liquid.
- Heat 100 ml of milk, froth it, and pour it onto your coffee. Now’s a good time to [practice your latte art technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiefJJv-Qho), if you’re into that sort of thing.
- Enjoy!
