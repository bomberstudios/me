Today I learned that (to no one's surprise, really) there is a World Championship of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

[In this article](https://priceonomics.com/the-world-of-competitive-rock-paper-scissors/), besides explaining what professional RPS is all about, they take the opportunity to mention a scene from "The Princess Bride" that gives its name to a type of logical reasoning called "Sicilian Reasoning," which is one of the keys to becoming a better Rock, Paper, Scissors player.
