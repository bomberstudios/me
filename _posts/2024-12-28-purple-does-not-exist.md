Apparently, [purple does not exist](https://btr.mt/analects/purple-doesn't-exist) (I swear this is not an April's Fools[^1] prank, I hate that kind of joke).

(This was imported from [the original message in my Telegram group](https://t.me/naranjanaranja/322), in Spanish).

[^1]: In Spain, we have our own version of April's Fools, only it happens on December 28th. The celebration [commemorates a child massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_the_Innocents) ðŸ™ƒ, so make of that what you will.
