description: A bunch of random data about my bike rides in 2024

As 2024 comes to an end, I thought it would be interesting to look at some stats from this year (I'm clearly not riding my bikes until next year, since I'm away from home).

All data comes from Garmin Connect, via my Garmin FÄ“nix 6 Pro (I *love* this thing and wear it 24/7).

Apparently, I've ridden my bikes 98 times. That's 115 hours, for 1958 kilometers. That's way less than what I'd like and deserve, but way better than last year (1775 kilometers in 85 hours).

My best year to date was 2022, where I used my funployment time to ride as much as I could: 2115 kilometers in 107 hours.

In other news, my total ascent was 13000+ meters (almost an Everest and a half!), and I burned about 945.000 calories. Funnily enough, I weight exactly the same I did at the end of last year, so clearly science is a scam.

My plan for next year is to keep having fun on two wheels, but also go back to running a bit. My true love is riding bikes, but I miss trail running, and I have to admit it reduces my stress levels way more than biking does.

P.S: Feel free to [follow me on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/70765925). Also, if you ever come near Aranjuez and would like to go for a ride, please shout!
