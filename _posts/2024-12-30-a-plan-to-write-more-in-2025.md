description: A simple idea to get myself to write more in the new year.

I've been thinking about [yesterday's post](/how-to-read-10x-more-books/), and how the plan I used to read more books didn't really work for other things like making music, or learning new things.

I clearly need a different approach for writing, and I think I have a plan to write more in 2025. But first, let me digress a bit.

About a year ago, I started a [Telegram group](https://t.me/naranjanaranja) to share the things I find online with my friends. I've been posting there almost daily, and it's been a great way to keep in touch with people I care about, with zero expectations about its utility or reach.

I post in Spanish, and sometimes I'll share some of those posts in English on [my Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/bomberstudios.com). But now that I think about it, it doesn't make much sense to publish there, and not here.

Soâ€¦ I'm going to start re-sharing some of those posts here, probably with some edits beyond translating them to English. I'll keep the original date and time, and I'll add a link to the original post on Telegram.

Moving forward, the plan is to either post simultaneously on both platforms, or to post there first and then share in here. I'll see how it goes.

I'll share some stats about the whole thing in a year, and we'll see if this plan to write more in 2025 works out. Wish me luck! ðŸ¤ž
