If you design apps for Mac (or are simply interested in the topic), [Mario Guzman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marioguzman/) has a couple of design guides on his website: one on [general layout](https://marioaguzman.github.io/design/layoutguidelines/), and another one [specifically for toolbars](https://marioaguzman.github.io/design/toolbarguidelines/).

The toolbar guide delves a bit into implementation and code, but both are fantastic resources even if you are not a developer.
