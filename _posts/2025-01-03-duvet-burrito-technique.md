I just searched for this video on YouTube because I had to make a bed, and it is my moral obligation to share it in case you're not already familiar with it: ["How to put a duvet cover hack: the roll method"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyxzxLloOV0)

Hope you like it and it saves you time (and sanity).
