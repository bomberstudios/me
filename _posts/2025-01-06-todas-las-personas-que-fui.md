I just finished reading this comic book and enjoyed it very much, probably because I was looking at the main character and seeing myself in him.

I recently went through a similar experience to the one the author was talking about and it felt reassuring to see we went through it with sort of the same approach.

I don't think I'm entirely done with my own crisis, but reading this book validates my belief that I'm definitely over the worst part .
