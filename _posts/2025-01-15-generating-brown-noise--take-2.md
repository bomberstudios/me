Following yesterday's post about brown noise generation, I have a found a way more convenient way of solving the problem: Apple’s Accessibility features.

Starting on iOS 14 / macOS 13, you can use a feature called “Background Sounds” to play different types of background noise. The one called “Dark Noise” sounds to me like brown noise, but there are others like “Bright Noise” (probably white noise), “Balanced Noise” (probably pink noise) and other natural sounding sounds like rain or fire.

Check System Settings › Accessibility › Audio on macOS, or Settings › Accessibility › Audio & Visual on iOS to set it up.

You can even add a menubar option on macOS to have them one click away:

On iOS, you can add it to your control center too.

Hope it helps!
