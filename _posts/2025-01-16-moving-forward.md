Putting into action [something I wrote about a few days ago](/action-and-happiness), I’ve now taken some actual steps to get closer to where I want to be. Action.

As a result of that, I’ve been sitting on my desk for 4 hours nonstop, working on something *for me*. I can’t remember the last time I felt so focused and so motivated (other than riding a bike, that is).

Onwards!
