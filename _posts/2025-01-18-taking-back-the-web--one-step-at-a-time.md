I came across this new web framework (wait, donâ€™t start pulling your hair out yet) that plans to undo most of the damage inflicted on us by abominations like React: [Nue.js](https://nuejs.org).

[The announcement](https://nuejs.org/blog/standards-first-web-framework/) and the [Vision page](https://nuejs.org/vision/) are a pretty bold declaration of intentions.

I hope the project succeeds and finds some traction (itâ€™s just one person at the moment) because we really need something like that.

Letâ€™s see where this goes ðŸ¤ž
