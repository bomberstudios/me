When [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app) shut down last year, I started looking for alternatives.

Since then, I’ve tried [Wallabag](https://www.wallabag.it/en) (a commendable open source project that's too unpolished for my taste), [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io) (beautiful, but ultimately too complex for my simple needs) and [Anybox](https://anybox.app) (very similar to Raindrop).

None of them worked for me. I kept using Raindrop because it was _not bad_, but it’s not lovable either.

But today I found something…

Someone mentioned [GoodLinks](https://goodlinks.app) on a Reddit comment (of course it was Reddit) and after checking their website and a couple of video reviews to make sure I was not throwing my money away, I bit the bullet and bought it (it’s just €10, but I love drama).

This thing is *exactly* what I was looking for. It does a few things, very well.

What I wanted was:

- a simple inbox to throw things I’d like to read, with optional tagging
- combined with a nice reader experience with highlighting + notes
- full text search of all articles
- and reasonable ways of getting my notes out to a notes app (NotePlan in my case)

That last point is where most tools failed. But GoodLinks has *great* support for Shortcuts app. It took me 5 minutes to set up a nice workflow to get my highlights and notes into NotePlan, with zero coding.

The only negatives: only works on Apple platforms, and it does not have a trial version. Both are things I can live with, and I’m really glad I found this app.

Take a look at it at [goodlinks.app](https://goodlinks.app/)

Hope it helps!
