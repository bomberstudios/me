Today, while reading [The Effective Product Designer](https://productdesigninterview.com/the-effective-product-designer), I came across an interesting concept: the _favor battery_.

I was already familiar with the idea, and probably you are too, but it’s nice to have a name for it.

The author describes the favor battery as “how much regard you’ve earned from others and thus how inclined they are to give their time and effort to support you”. I’ve always called it “karma”, but this version sounds less esoteric.

Like all batteries, you can recharge the favor battery. You do that by helping others. In this context, “helping” can mean anything from sharing insights to praising someone publicly for their achievements. Be generous, and you’ll receive back.

Of course, you can also discharge your battery. Making other people waste their time is a very effective way of depleting your favor battery.

TLDR: be nice to people, and people will be nice to you.

Something the author does not mention, though, and that I think is important is this: you _need_ to let other people recharge their batteries with you. Human relationships require some amount of reciprocity to be pleasant for everyone involved. If you’re always helping others, but don’t let them help you back, you’re creating an imbalance that can hurt some people. You’re also depriving yourself of the pleasure of _not doing some things_.

So, while you’re out there recharging your favor battery, maybe take some time to share what you need, to inspire others to help you back.

Have a nice day!
