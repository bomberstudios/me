Hi! I'm Ale Muñoz, a digital toolsmith who loves writing code to help people do more with less work (i.e: I'm a Good Lazy™).

I work for [Sketch](https://sketch.com), but you may have used some of the stuff I've created over the years (especially if you've written ActionScript or used Adobe Fireworks).

This is my personal site, where I write about life, the universe and everything (though I tend to gravitate towards design, technology and personal reflections).

I started it for a variety of reasons, some of which are:
- I love writing, but the kind of writing I do these days is almost never in long-form format. I hope to change that by publishing my crap on the web.
- Although I write *a lot* every day, almost none of that content is truly mine. Most of it is stored in 3rd party platforms like Slack, Twitter, Facebook, various forums…
- Last, but not least, I miss the tinkering associated with maintaining a personal site (even though I'm *really* trying to [stop complicating my life](/stop-complicating-your-life/).
