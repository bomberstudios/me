## Ale, Today

This is my personal site, where I write about life, the universe and everything (though I tend to gravitate towards design, technology and humor).

I started it for a variety of reasons, some of which are:
- I love writing, but the kind of writing I do these days is almost never in long-form format. I hope to change that by publishing my crap on the web.
- Although I write *a lot* every day, almost none of that content is truly mine. Most of it is stored in 3rd party platforms like Slack, Twitter, Facebook, various forumsâ€¦
- Last, but not least, I miss the tinkering associated with maintaining a personal site :sweat:
