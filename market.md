Here's a list of the things I have for sale. My preference is for in-person delivery (in Madrid), but if you absolutely must have something, let me know and I'll see what I can do.

Please [contact me over Telegram](https://t.me/bomberstudios) for more details about anything.

## For sale

### Akai MPC One, €600

Brand new, with original box. Bought it in February and it hasn't seen much use (thus me selling it). Comes with an extra 32 Gb SD card.

Note: the case has a few scratches, that were there when I took it out of the box the first time. Apparently, there was an issue in the manufacturing process for the plastics and a few units look like that. It is just a minor cosmetic issue, but I thought I'd mention it.


### iPad Pro 11", €700

64 Gb model from 2018. Comes with Pencil 2 and Smart Keyboard Folio case (in Spanish layout).
The screen has a very thin scratch that is *really* hard to see, barely noticeable with your finger, and can only be felt with the Pencil tip of your fingernail. A screen protector will get rid of it.


### iMac Retina 5k 27", €1800

- 2017 model
- 4.2 GHz Quad Core Inter Core i7
- 32 Gb DDR4 RAM
- Radeon Pro 580 8Gb
- 2TB Fusion Drive
- Magic Keyboard (Spanish) + Magic Mouse

Immaculate condition, only used in a smoke-free house. Screen has no dead pixels. I don't have the original box, so transportation will need some logistics.


### Preonic Mechanical Keyboard, €100
