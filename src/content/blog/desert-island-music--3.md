It was the summer of ’95.

For my birthday, my friend _Mariángeles_ gave me a wink and a cassette tape.

When I got back home that night and played it on my walkman, I had my mind blown to pieces. That album changed the way I listen to music, forever.

I have since lost the tape, and my friend’s phone number (don’t judge me, things were different back then).

But I will never lose the memory of the way Chemical Brothers made me feel the first time I listened to [Exit Planet Dust](https://www.discogs.com/master/23493-The-Chemical-Brothers-Exit-Planet-Dust).

Listen in [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1Bmuyq89rXZJNK1w8pauEg), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/es/album/exit-planet-dust/723670972) or, if you have the chance, a crunchy cassette tape player.
