When Violeta was 2 years old, you could almost have a full conversation with her. She started speaking very early, and I’ve always enjoyed the fact that I could chat with her about pretty much anything. 

Maya, on the other hand, is taking her sweet time to speak. Her pronunciation is funny, and her vocabulary is quite random (she goes to an American school, and she mixes Spanish and English).

However, for all the skills she lacks, she’s armed with an unlimited supply of happiness and joy for all the little things.

I look forward to the day when I can have a conversation with her, but when that time comes I know I’ll miss the magical moments when she manages to share her little vision of the world around her.

An hour ago, I was looking at the dark night sky, and she came asking where the moon was.

– “There’s no moon tonight, Maya”

She then proceeds to look up, opens her mouth and says

– “Ooooh, but there’s _glitter_!”
