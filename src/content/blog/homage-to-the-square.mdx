I was looking for something completely unrelated to this (documentation for using themes in [HighCharts](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/themes) ðŸ™ƒ), when I came across this beauty by Josef Albers.

There is something about the simplicity of the squares and the colors that makes me feel at peace. I can't explain it, but I love it. I hope you do too.
