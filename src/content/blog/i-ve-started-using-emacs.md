I was getting increasingly mad with VS Code lately (random slowdowns, UX issues, and a general sense of it being built with wire and duct tape).

So I took that as a sign to finally start using a "forever editor" like vim or emacs.

I've always had a soft spot in my heart for emacs. My brother used to hack it by smashing his IBM Model M keyboard back in the day, and we bonded a lot geeking over its magical powers.

I also have a strong desire to use [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org), which is only available inside emacs.

My brain is still not onboard with this plan, but I've decided to use the same approach I used when I [learned to touch-type](https://ale.today/learning-to-touch-type): ignore logic and start moving. I'll get there, eventually.

We'll see how it goes!
