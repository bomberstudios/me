Yesterday night, me and my wife went to see Jorge Drexler play his last album live in Seville. It was an amazing concert, and we were lucky enough to get tickets on the 2nd row. Being so close to Jorge and seeing how his eyes got wet when singing one of my favorite songs made the whole night worth it.

Jorge Drexler is not only a talented singer and songwriter, but also happens to be a charming and funny story teller. If you ever get the chance to go see him, don’t miss the opportunity to go learn a trick or two about public speaking, seducing a crowd, and being funny and poetic all at the same time.

For a taste of what Mr. Drexler feels like on stage, you can watch this TED Talk. Yes, I know it’s a bit weird to recommend a TED Talk in 2020 (by a white dude, no less) but trust me on this one. It also ends with that song where he almost cried last night. What a nice coincidence.
