Today I’m playing with [omlet.dev](https://omlet.dev) (a tool to get analytics on how and where your React components are used) and **I’m loving it**. It works beautifully out of the box, and they just released a VS Code extension that’s *magic*.

It shouldn't be too surprising, since it comes from the same people who made [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io), a tool that changed the landscape of design tools back in the day.

If you have a project with React components, take it for a spin because it'll tell you things about your own code that you may not already know. Setup is a breeze (it took me less than 5 minutes), and you get a dashboard with all kinds of metrics, and suggestions to improve your code and the adoption of your design system.

If you want something even faster, try the [VS Code extension](https://omlet.dev/extension). It's free, and you don't need to register anywhere to use it. Just install it, open a React project, and you're good to go. You'll get immediate, actionable feedback on how to clean up your code.

If you want to get a quick overview of what you’re getting with Omlet, check out this video. I promise you won’t regret it.
