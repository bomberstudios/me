One of the things I loved (and miss) from the early internet days is the remix spirit. Everything was there for you to tinker with it, experiment, and make it your own.

I must thank [@javierarce](https://javier.computer) for keeping that spirit alive and sharing [the code he uses to publish posts on his blog via a GitHub comment](https://github.com/javierarce/javier.computer/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml).

Just today I was having [a very interesting conversation on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bomberstudios/status/1613088649478049793) about the merits of abusing software to perform tasks that it was clearly not designed to do. So yay for serendipity, and here’s hope the future looks more like the early 00s and less like the early 20s.
