My parents love cheese. And wine.

They also enjoy drinking from the same glass. I find that lovely, but it makes it really hard for them to make predictions about when they’ll run out of wine, or cheese:

— We’ve run out of wine but still have cheese left. Let’s pour another glass.

— Ah, now we’ve run out of cheese but there’s still some wine left. Let’s get some more cheese.

_Rinse and repeat until they finish their wine and cheese at the same time._
