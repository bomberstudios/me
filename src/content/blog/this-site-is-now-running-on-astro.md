I know you don’t care too much about the internals of this blog, but just in case you do: after 5 years of using Jekyll to power this site, I finally decided to upgrade to something a bit more modern.

If you’re reading this, it means the migration was successful and we’re riding a rocket powered by [Astro](https://astro.build).

In addition to being a great tool, Astro has one of the best communities I’ve ever interacted with. They’re beyond nice, and they make having issues with Astro _an enjoyable experience._

I’m looking forward to getting the most of it in the coming months.
