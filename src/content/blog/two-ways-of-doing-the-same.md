In [Zed](https://zed.dev), you can opt out of all AI features, by _enabling_ this option:

AFFiNE, on the other hand, makes you _disable_ the AI features:

To me, it feels like Zed is presenting the removal of AI features _as a feature itself_. AFFiNE, on the other hand, is nudging you into leaving that switch alone _or you'll miss something great_.

I have no idea if this is intentional, but it's a great example of how subtle differences in design can change your perception of the software you use.
