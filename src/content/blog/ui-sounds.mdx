import { RoundToggle } from '@components/RoundToggle.tsx'
import ComponentDemo from '@components/ComponentDemo.astro'

Yesterday, I was browsing [Josh Comeau's website](https://www.joshwcomeau.com) and came across something I did not know I needed: ["A React Hook for Sound Effects"](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/announcing-use-sound-react-hook/).

When Josh says "I wish the web was louder", my inner DJ, music maker, and ex-multimedia designer all scream in unison saying "hell yeah".

*Of course*, I had to take his library for a spin. And I have to say, I'm enjoying this throwback to the days when I got started with Flash. The web does indeed need a bit more sound.

Just the excuse I needed to grab a mic and record some silly sounds:

<ComponentDemo>
  <RoundToggle client:only="react" enabled={false} size={64} playSound />
</ComponentDemo>

No hard promises, but expect more of this from me.
