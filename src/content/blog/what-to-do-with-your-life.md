[Julian Shapiro](https://www.julian.com) is, in many ways, a person I look up to for inspiration.

He has a couple of (very well-written) guides about two topics I’m interested in: [writing](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro), and [building muscle](https://www.julian.com/guide/muscle/intro).

But that’s not why I’m mentioning him today.

I was looking for his writing guide, and came across this post that I don’t remember reading back in the day: [What to do with your life](https://www.julian.com/blog/life-planning).

Feels like a very appropriate read for starting a new year, so I’m going to spend some time reading and thinking about it.
