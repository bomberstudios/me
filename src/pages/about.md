Hi! I'm Ale Muñoz.

I'm a designer / digital toolsmith who loves building tools to help people do more with less. You may have used some of the projects I've created if you've written ActionScript or used Fireworks or Sketch.

My hobbies are eating, cooking, and _never shutting up_. My favorite color is orange, but I can design anything in any color.

This is my personal site. I write about life, the universe and everything, though I tend to gravitate towards design, technology and personal reflections.

It serves multiple purposes:

- I love writing, but the kind of writing I do these days is almost never
  in long-form format. I hope to change that by publishing my crap on the web.
- Although I write *a lot* every day, almost none of that content is truly mine.
  Most of it gets stored in 3rd party platforms like Slack, Twitter, Facebook,
  various forums…
- Last, but not least, I miss the tinkering associated with maintaining
  a personal site. Even though I'm *really* trying to [stop complicating my life](/stop-complicating-your-life/).
